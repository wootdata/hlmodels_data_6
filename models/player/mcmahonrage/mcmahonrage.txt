About the Author============================================
Since I had Austin made, i had to make his worst enemy. Thats right 
Vince McMahon is around now to get his ass kicked.
Both these skins make a great team game, for all those maps that were
ment for two teams. It'll be interesting what team gets to pick skins 
though, oh well thats not my problem. =)  Go nuts with the corporation 
leader.    Drop me aline anytime:    manny@cgocabe.net
