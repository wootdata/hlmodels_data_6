____________________
This is an edited model previously created by Neal 'Guplik' Corbett.
I editied this model with further perfection and detail for the true matrix
 fan.  I fixed, added, and edited multiple parts of the model which u can
easily notice form Guplink's  version. 
-remodeled breasts
-adjusted spine formation
-skinned the pants, boots, buckles
-added a 3D hair srand in front of her face
-remodeled boots to look femenine rather than square
-added chromed buckles to boots
-fixed the allingment of the face skin
-fixed the nostrils 
-fixed the skin colour strand that appeared on the back of her head
-skinned the shirt  (it was just a black colour like the pants)
-lightened the belt skin

***Special thanks go out to Scarecrow and the many many people that
helped me test this model in servers every so often. Without 
ScareCrow's gidance this model would not have been made possible.***
Thats all, hope you enjoy this model as much as I did creating it.
I will now continue my work on Morpheus, and Neo. 
The Matrix has you.............

July, 2008:

-Added custom Matrix-like animations that were with the DM version of this model.
-Adjusted skin to compensate for "UV-shift."

That is all

This particular model has been around a LONG time - HL Deathmatch, as well as Sven Coop. Therefore, I see no reason to take credit for something as simple as adding animations. 


Jan, 2009:

Unfortunately, SC 4.0b isn't always compatible with all custom animations - this version has standard SC 4.0b animations.
