Well, the title says all. Yes this is Heart of Evil Napalm Edition Content (the characters) hacked for Half-Life / Opposing Force and Sven Coop player models. Why I'm making this? Since I love this mod, and I would like to play with those models in HL/OP & SC. Since I think there are many SC/HL lovers that would like to see those awesome models in HL and SC. I have hacked those models long ago, but I haven't released them up until now since I just got permission from Saxon to release them. I hope you like them.

Those models will work for Half - Lfe, Sven Coop and Opposing Force. They have corresponding overviews for ingame model selection.

All models remain property of their original owners. In order to modify them you have to ask them first for permission.
