Thank you for downloading Wood Pixie, from Inkblot! This skin is based on 
ccsakura. I don't much like card captors, but when I saw the model on cold 
fusion, it was just screaming pixie at me. So this is my first, very hurried 
try at this. I think I'll make a flower pixie next. E-mail me at 
pendragon666@worldnet.att.net or rate my work on WON. Thank you.
